# Cheeses
Cheese API and Cheese POC, each with docker files for building environments

The API is designed to run on port 3000 <br />
The POC is designed to run on port 3001 <br />

If I had more time I would improve the following: <br />

- More stylised front end / more css <br />
- More CRUD capabilities on the front end so that it can be fully self reliant <br />
- Persistent strage for the API e.g. a relational db <br />
- Initial cheese within the API once it is started <br />
- Better unit testing and more unit testing for the POC <br />
